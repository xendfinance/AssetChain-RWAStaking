# Sample Hardhat Project

Use the Open Zeppelin Version that is compatible with solidity 0.6.12 which is openzeppelin 3.4 . You can upgrade the entire project to use higher versions of openzeppelin if you wish to

npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@3.4


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
